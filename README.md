# Lex-Python-StudentProject-Instacart
### Summary
This student project I completed with CareerFoundry centered on using Python with the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries, to manipulate and produce visualizations from a large data set. In this repository, you can browse the final project folder containing all Python scripts, visualizations, and client-facing Excel presentation.
### Project Premise
The online grocery shopping company Instacart is planning to deploy a targeted marketing strategy. My analysis uses an open source data set of over 3 million real orders from Instacart and focuses on finding actionable insights about customer behavior through profiling and other means.
